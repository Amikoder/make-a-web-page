<!--Commenty Comment Comment.  Gonna attempt to clean this up by applying some of the concepts shown in the last few videos: creating div classes, apply indentation to organize (though a quick copy/paste in scratchpad to use the handy indentation lines showed that to be a work in progress), minimizing redundancy, using the proper tags, hopefully all with the possibility of writing as little CSS as possible. Oh, and double checking for spelling errors. <.<    

Why didn't you guys mention that Sublime has a spell checker?! And the little indentation lines?! Now if only it can tell me why I can't find the p elements that are messing everything up...

            People with computers download browers; browsers, using HTTP, send out queries and return webpages plucked from super-space-saving filing-cabinet computers called servers...hidden in air conditioned closets.
           </p>
           <p>
            These pages are usually formatted using HTML, 
            <b>hypertext markup language</b>, and can contain <em>almost anything</em>: text, images, videos, links, pdf's, multiple levels.  The browser reads the text, markup and references to turn the information into something user-friendly.
           </p>

         <p>
           Elements are used in markup, which controls how a webpage, and its content, look.  Elements consist, usually, of an <b>opening tag, content, and a closing tag</b>. Some elements, called <span class="bold">void tags</span>, don't need closing tags. 
             <div class="example"> 
                Line break: {br} <br>
                and the image element: {img  src="url" alt="text"} 
               <br>
                are two examples of void tags
               <br>
               <br>
                Bold, and/or Strong: {b}text{/b}, {strong}text{/strong}
               <br> need closing tags
            </div>
         </p>
         <p>
            Elements can be either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>.  Inline elements create no additional space around them and can "butt" right up against text.  Block elements create a box in which their content resides. 
              <div class="example">
                Line break {br} is inline, but paragraph {p}{/p}<p>is block text</p>
                and created the space preceeding and following the above line. 
              </div>
            <br>
            But both are necessary to manage the "white space" on an HTML page, since spaces and carriage returns are rendered null when a browser reads HTML. Multiple spaces and any carriage returns are turned into a single space.  Space, therefore, has to be deliberately coded in.
        </p>
        <p>
           Attributes, span/div
        <br>
           Attributes modify their elements, or are properties of elements. Span and Div, for instance, can have attributes added to them. Both elements contain text, Span is inline and Div is block.  Neither are void tags.  Div behaves much like the paragraph tag, but doesn't create as much space around it.

              Back in the day, I once read a book.  Mostly because it was the assigned textbook of a high level class taught by an affluent scholar.  I read books for other reasons too, but, to be frank, <em>The History of Literary Criticism</em> never made it's way on to my bucketlist of its own merit. But, turns out, betwixt the covers of that dusty tome many a gem lie hidden.  Take, for instance, the contention of T.S. Elliot that "immature poets imitate, mature poets steal."  
              </p>
              <p>
              While there might have been some liberal interpretations and cavalier applications of this concept in my younger days, insofar as it applies to the dissemination of ideas, knowledge, and the interconnected nature of progress, it's quite apt. And fun. Fun is key. But to the point, if one reads T.S. Elliot's idea with a mind pointed onward and upward, they grasp the heart of progress and learning. Something that seems to be a theme with Udacity's Intro to Programming course. Oh, and it doesn't hurt to read the text surrounding this oft-misquoted tidbit, which dispels any notions of professional or scholarly misconduct. 
              <br>
              <br>
              That's all.  Moving on.

          Looking at the code of existing web pages provides excellent examples of code-in-action. Not only can you see the end product, but <em>how</em> the elements and style are formatted correctly to follow HTML (or CSS) syntax and rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google Chrome's developer tools provides user-friendly ways to sift through complex DOMs, as well as see how coders are using CSS to minimize redundancy. At first glance, all that code hidden behind little triangles make it seem easy.  And then you click that nesting triangle and fall down the rabbit hole.  Deeper and deeper.  Oh, and they make it easy to pick out boxes.  Boxes, boxes, everywhere.
        </p>

         Programmer's text editors also make learning/performing programming easier.  Programs for writing programs! Or web pages, in this case.  They will, for instance, provide a corresponding closing tag for your opening one.

         <p> 
           As mentioned previously, CSS controls how an HTML page <em>looks</em>.  It also saves coders substantial time by allowing them to apply a repetitive style to multiple elements of the same type.  
         </p>
         <p>
          There are three ways to add style to a page:
         <br>
          1. Writing it in the head element of the HTML page. 
         <br>
          2. Within the head element, add a link to a seperate CSS file. This keeps large projects organized, and looks something like this:
            <div class="example">
              {link: rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="main.css"}
            </div>
         <br>
          3. Writing the style inline with the HTML.  Not the best choice, leads to a lot of repetition.  
        </p>
     </div>
   </div>
  
   <div class="section" id="1.CSS-benefits">
     <div class="section-title">
         Some Particulars of CSS
     </div>
       <div class="notes">
         <p>
           CSS both helps avoid repetition and maintain consistency by applying a singular style to an unlimited number of instances of the same element. This, handily enough, also makes implementing changes easier. It's also ruled by an abstract concept called inheritance.  In a page of CSS code, the most specific rule applies. If a class has a specific attribute, and there's a class nested within it without any attributes specified, the nested class shares the attribute of the parent (ancestor) class. 
         </p>
              <div class="example"> 
                A CSS Element:
               <br>
                h1 {
                background-color: black;
                }
               <br>
               <br>
               "h1" is the selector. 
               <br>
               "background-color: black;" is the declaration
               <br> 
                "background-color is the property
               <br>
                and "black" is the value

           1. Look for natural boxes <br>
           2. Look for repeated styles & semantic elements <br>
           3. Write HTML <br>
           4. Apply styles (big to small) <br>
           5. Fix things (check various browsers, and resize windows) <br>
           6. Verify <a href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">HTML</a> and <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input">CSS</a>
         </p>
         <p>
           Verify to ensure that your page and code displays properly in all browsers.
         <br>
           Currently, this page displays 4 errors and 3 warnings.  I have no idea what the warnings mean. But, the errors display extraneous closing p tags. <!-- Maybe it's because I'm having difficulty with the indentation consistency? The discussion forums are currently down, I was going to hop on there and see about having someone look this over, but I'm just going to go ahead and submit it in the hopes that my reviewer, you code guru you, can help a girl out?-->
